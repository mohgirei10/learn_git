It looks like you want to add the file `third.txt` to a Git repository. Here are the steps to do that:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing your file:
    ```sh
    cd /c:/Users/USER/Desktop/learn_git
    ```
3. Initialize a new Git repository (if you haven't already):
    ```sh
    git init
    ```
4. Add the file to the staging area:
    ```sh
    git add third.txt
    ```
5. Commit the file to the repository:
    ```sh
    git commit -m "Add third.txt"
    ```

This will add `third.txt` to your Git repository and commit it.
